Simple Smart Contract Interaction


This project demonstrates how to interact with a basic Ethereum smart contract using a web interface. The smart contract, written in Solidity, includes two state variables (value1 and value2) and functions to update these values.

Features
Smart Contract: Written in Solidity with functions to update and retrieve state variables.
Frontend Interface: Developed using HTML and JavaScript with Web3.js integration.
Display Values: Shows current values of the smart contract's state variables on the webpage.
Update Values: Provides buttons to update the state variables directly from the web interface.
Setup
Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network and obtain the contract address and ABI.
Replace placeholders in app.js with your smart contract address and ABI.
Open index.html in a web browser to interact with the contract.
This project serves as a foundational example for integrating Ethereum smart contracts with a web frontend, demonstrating how to call contract functions and display results on a webpage
